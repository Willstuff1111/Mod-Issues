## FAQ
### Will you downgrade your mods?
Probably not. Most mods are at 1.20+, but I highly doubt they'll go below that.
### Will you update your mods?
Unless otherwise specified, the mod will be updated. I'm probably just working on something else at the time.
### Will your mods be ported to other sites?
No, and if one of these mods is found on another site please report it to me.
### Will your mods be ported to other Minecraft Mod software?
Depends on the mod. None of the ones for 1.18+ will ever be ported to Forge.
Glass Heart, as an example, will be ported to Paper, Fabric, and turned into a Datapack, but will never be changed to Forge after the original.
